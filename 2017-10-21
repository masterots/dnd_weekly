The party discovers a classroom with desks, chairs and a blackboard with "The Great One Lives" written on it.
Between the classroom and an old library, is a short hallway with a pit trap.  Hugh falls in and Eggbert goes down to join Hugh.  Soon, the pit fills with oil.  As the others are trying to open the hatch, a torch (unlit) falls into the pit.  Thankfully, the oil does not ignite.
Grim explores the library.  A camoflauged spider drops on his back and attacks.  After dispatching the spider, a scroll is found.
The party enters an antechamber with 2 statues, made of crystal, which attack on site.
The antechamber leads into a fountain room.  Tapestries show Princess Argenta and the black-armored man, sitting peacefully with each other.  The fountain contains water.
There is a hallway here that seems to have been destroyed, which blocks off further progress down the corridor.  Openings in the rock show that the red light still persists outside.
Whispering is heard near the rubble.  The party makes out the following phrases being discussed: infiltrating local towns, scouting caves, raising the Great One, killing wizards, finding gems for the master, gates, the need to kill a cleric.  They were both wearing the same masks seen on the 2 assassins that killed Tugg's mother.  The party kills them.
The party finds a room covered in some sort of ooze which turns out to be green slime.  Fire seems to kill it.
The party discovers a subterranean chamber about 50' x 50'  The liquid in the chamber bubbles.  The gas in here causes nausea and choking.  Leeroy casts Mage Hand and lowers a dagger into the pool.  It comes back corroded.  The party steps back into the hallway and Leeroy casts firebolt into the chamber, causing a massive explosion which damages the party as fire and rock billow up the hallway.  The explosion takes out this section of the castle.
Severely damaged, the party runs off into a room, where orcs show up, investigating the explosion.  They attack and quickly dispatch every party member except Tugg, who barely finishes off the last orc.
Tugg is able to get Leeroy back up and together they quickly search rooms for any kind of aid.
One room contains what appears to be some sort of ghastly apparition behind a folding screen.  The party leaves this room (it turns out to be clothing moving in the wind).
Another room appears to be some sort of butcher room.  A pit in front of the butcher block contains carcasses of animals and giant rats that are feeding on them.
A room adjacent appears to be wear they store meat.  It is cold and an odd mist comes up from the floor (no effect).
Another room contains a beautiful crystal harp with silver strings.  Tapestries show the life of a female minstrel.  Tugg and Leeroy take the harp.
Another room contained a small silver statue of a dragon readying for flight.  It is "guarded" by 5 "men" that appear to be alive, although have wounds on them that would kill anyone (Eggbert identifies these as undead zombies).
Another room looks like a bedroom.  Furniture is smashed and blood stains are found on the bedsheets.
Another room contains 5 double bunk beds.  "Beware of Travis" is scrawled on the wall.  Travis soons shows up and draws his sword and tells the party to leave immediately.  They leave.
Another room contains 10 statues of guards at attention.  A dead body of a man lies on the floor.  He has nothing of value.
Another room contains a wolf, which attacks the party.  After being dispatched, the party finds a healing ointment.  It is used to heal Tugg, who then brings the other members to consciousness.  The party then takes a long rest.
