- The party discovers a classroom with desks, chairs and a blackboard with "The Great One Lives" written on it.
- Between the classroom and an old library, is a short hallway with a pit trap.  Hugh falls in and Eggbert goes down to join Hugh.  Soon, the pit fills with oil.  As the others are trying to open the hatch, a torch (unlit) falls into the pit.  Thankfully, the oil does not ignite.
- Grim explores the library.  A camoflauged spider drops on his back and attacks.  After dispatching the spider, a scroll is found.
- The party enters an antechamber with 2 statues, made of crystal, which attack on site.
- The antechamber leads into a fountain room.  Tapestries show Princess Argenta and the black-armored man, sitting peacefully with each other.  The fountain contains water.
- There is a hallway here that seems to have been destroyed, which blocks off further progress down the corridor.  Openings in the rock show that the red light still persists outside.
- Whispering is heard near the rubble.  The party makes out the following phrases being discussed: infiltrating local towns, scouting caves, raising the Great One, killing wizards, finding gems for the master, gates, the need to kill a cleric.  They were both wearing the same masks seen on the 2 assassins that killed Tugg's mother.  The party kills them.
- The party finds a room covered in some sort of ooze which turns out to be green slime.  Fire seems to kill it.
- The party discovers a subterranean chamber about 50' x 50'  The liquid in the chamber bubbles.  The gas in here causes nausea and choking.  Leeroy casts Mage Hand and lowers a dagger into the pool.  It comes back corroded.  The party steps back into the hallway and Leeroy casts firebolt into the chamber, causing a massive explosion which damages the party as fire and rock billow up the hallway.  The explosion takes out this section of the castle.
- Severely damaged, the party runs off into a room, where orcs show up, investigating the explosion.  They attack and quickly dispatch every party member except Tugg, who barely finishes off the last orc.
- Tugg is able to get Leeroy back up and together they quickly search rooms for any kind of aid.
- One room contains what appears to be some sort of ghastly apparition behind a folding screen.  The party leaves this room (it turns out to be clothing moving in the wind).
- Another room appears to be some sort of butcher room.  A pit in front of the butcher block contains carcasses of animals and giant rats that are feeding on them.
- A room adjacent appears to be wear they store meat.  It is cold and an odd mist comes up from the floor (no effect).
- Another room contains a beautiful crystal harp with silver strings.  Tapestries show the life of a female minstrel.  Tugg and Leeroy take the harp.
- Another room contained a small silver statue of a dragon readying for flight.  It is "guarded" by 5 "men" that appear to be alive, although have wounds on them that would kill anyone (Eggbert identifies these as undead zombies).
- Another room looks like a bedroom.  Furniture is smashed and blood stains are found on the bedsheets.
- Another room contains 5 double bunk beds.  "Beware of Travis" is scrawled on the wall.  Travis soons shows up and draws his sword and tells the party to leave immediately.  They leave.
- Another room contains 10 statues of guards at attention.  A dead body of a man lies on the floor.  He has nothing of value.
- Another room contains a wolf, which attacks the party.  After being dispatched, the party finds a healing ointment.  It is used to heal Tugg, who then brings the other members to consciousness.  The party then takes a long rest.
